      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">Meet the Founder</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Hello, I’m Keshe’a Cochran, Founder of Daughters Who Speak.</strong></p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">First, I want to say — I believe you. If you’re here, it’s likely because you’ve experienced something painful, confusing, and isolating — especially in a place or relationship that was supposed to be safe. Maybe it was a spiritual leader, mentor, or someone you trusted in your faith community. Maybe you were groomed, silenced, or spiritually manipulated. Maybe, like me, you were left carrying trauma that no one could see — or chose not to see.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">I know that pain. I know what it feels like to finally speak your truth, only to be met with disbelief, blame, or silence. I know what it’s like to wrestle with shame that wasn’t yours to carry. I know what it’s like to feel invisible — even in your church.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Daughters Who Speak exists for women just like you and me — women who were groomed under the guise of discipleship, gaslighted by spiritual leaders, or harmed by those who should have protected them.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">This is a safe place. A sacred place. Here, your voice matters. Your story matters. You will be met with support, not shame. Compassion, not condemnation. Truth, not manipulation.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Our mission is to break the silence surrounding spiritual abuse — and to help every daughter find her voice again.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><em>You are not alone. I hear you. I see you. And I believe you!</em></p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-6 font-semibold">With hope and healing,<br>Keshe’a Cochran<br><span class="text-pink-700">Founder, Daughters Who Speak</span></p>
